# Timed Quiz

## Description

This is a work day scheduler, created using JavaScript, jquery, Bootstrap, Moment, fontawesome, HTML, and CSS. The following requirements for its design were as follows: 

## Acceptance Criteria

    1. When the user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
    
    2. When the user scrolls down, they are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.

    3. When the user views the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

    4. When the user clicks into a timeblock, they can enter an event.

    5. When the user clicks the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
    
    6. When the user refreshes the page, the saved events persist.

By meeting these goals, this scheduler demonstrates the use of several new techniques, most prominently Moment, Bootstrap, and Jquery, and the code is easy to read and understand. 

I admit I spent the vast majority of my time on this project attempting to find a clean way to create the timeblocks using Jquery, but I struggled to find a way to add the different hours and IDs to those divs. Ultimately, my tutor advised me that it wasn't a requirement of the challenge, so I moved on. I still think it was useful as a research study. I tried dozens of methods and very nearly succeeded. I have left some of the code commented out in case anyone is interested. I'm looking forward to learning more about that. 

The remainder of the code was fairly straight forward. I did a fair amount of tinkering trying to get the look just right. I was delighted that the local storage worked so beautifully as I had struggled with that on the last challenge. Growth!

## Credits
The project team consists of the **UW Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp** instructors, teacher assistants, and students. My tutor Rene Trevino was invaluable assisting me in trouble shooting the color coding and storage. I read multiple tutorials trying to familiarize myself with new concepts. Below is a sampling of the websites and video I found most helpful over the last week. Some of them were for the code I eventually threw out, but helpful nonetheless.

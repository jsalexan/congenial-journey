# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a work day scheduler, created using JavaScript, jquery, Bootstrap, Moment, fontawesome, HTML, and CSS. The fields change styling according to the time of day and your schedule items are saved to local storage.

This app demonstrates the use of several new techniques, most prominently Moment, Bootstrap, and Jquery, and the code is easy to read and understand. 

The remainder of the code was fairly straight forward. I did a fair amount of tinkering trying to get the look just right. I was delighted that the local storage worked so beautifully as I had struggled with that on the last challenge. Growth!

## Credits
The project team consists of the **UW Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp** instructors, teacher assistants, and students. My tutor Rene Trevino was invaluable assisting me in trouble shooting the color coding and storage. I read multiple tutorials trying to familiarize myself with new concepts. Below is a sampling of the websites and video I found most helpful over the last week. Some of them were for the code I eventually threw out, but helpful nonetheless.
